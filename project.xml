<!-- 
    The project.xml generates build environments for:

        * android
        * autotool
        * cmake
        * mingw32
        * vs2008
        * vs2010
        * vs2012
        * vs2013

    Classes are automatically added to all build environments. Further as you
    add new classes to your project you can generate skeleton header and source 
    files according to http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:21.

    name := The name of your project
    description := A short description for your project
    script := The gsl script to generate all the stuff !!! DO NOT CHANGE !!!
    email := The email address where to reach you project e.g. mailinglist.

    description = "ZeroMQ mail agent"
    script = "zproject.gsl"
    email = "cb@oikosdev.net"

        These projects must be known by zproject, and the list of

        Models that we build using GSL. 
        This will generate a 'make code' target to build the models.
    <model name = "sockopts" />
    <model name = "zgossip" />
    <model name = "zgossip_msg" />

        If a model should be generated using a specific gsl script,
        this can be set through the script attribute:
    <model name = "hydra_msg" script = "zproto_codec_java.gsl" />

        Additional parameters to the script can be set via nested
        param elements:
    <model name = "hydra_msg" script = "zproto_codec_java.gsl">
        <param name = "root_path" value = "../main" />
    </model>
